# portfolio-opt
A Python application to help portfolio managers optimize their asset mix using streamlit and yfinance.

Modern Portfolio Theory suggests that investors should diversify by 
investing in a range of different assets in order to reduce the overall portfolio risk.

By diversifying and analysing their data,
investors are able to **limit risk exposure to an asset class** or sector,
**minimize the amount of volatility** they experience, and **reduce market fluctuation
impact** in their investments.

This app aims to help investors **ideate a balanced portfolio mix**
allowing you to **enter a range of instruments and show you interactive insights**. 
You could use this f.e. to help prevent being overly weighted in a single asset class or sector, 
while maintaining or improving your `expected returns`.

This app could help portfolio managers ultimately, **get a good return, respective to their risk apetite**.
